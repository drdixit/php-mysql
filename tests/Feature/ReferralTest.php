// testing community splits into two
// there are those who see testing as nothing more than a way to ensure that the code works
// and there is another group whose strongly feel that the way you approach your tests
// will help determine the design of your application
// from that perspective, the testing influences the design of your codebase


// don't worry about it, learn what you can, and then discard it all.
// just make it work for you
// so for example, writing these tests before your implementation code
// just doesn't work for you, no matter how hard you try don't do it.
// by the way, that refers to at test first development or test driven development

// there is no rules, the only rule is that you make this work for you

// there is dedicated tooling to assist with this
// there are tools like dusk, browser tests
// there are javascript tools that literally been in the browser and interact with your website like cyprus
// all of them are really useful
// for now just understand that what you might want to test
